This Dockerfile sets up an environment suitable for running vLLM with GPU support, and also provides a CPU-only version. Here's a breakdown of what this Dockerfile does:

It starts with the NVIDIA CUDA base image for Ubuntu 22.04, which includes CUDA 11.8.
It installs necessary system dependencies.
It installs Miniconda for managing Python environments.
It creates a conda environment named 'vllm' with Python 3.10.
Within this environment, it installs PyTorch with CUDA support.
It then installs vLLM and the OpenAI Python client.
It sets up a working directory and copies any application code you might have.
The default command is set to run a Python script (you'll need to replace 'your_script.py' with your actual script name).
Finally, it creates a CPU-only version by installing the CPU-only version of PyTorch.

To use this Dockerfile:

Save it as Dockerfile in your project directory.

Build the Docker image:

- For GPU support:
    ```bash
    docker build -t vllm-server .
    ```
- For CPU-only:
    ```bash
    docker build --target cpu -t vllm-server-cpu .
    ```

Run the Docker container:

- For GPU support:
    ```bash
    docker run --gpus all -p 8000:8000 vllm-server
    ```

- For CPU-only:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8000:8000 vllm-server-cpu
    ```

Remember to replace 'your_script.py' in the Dockerfile with the name of your actual Python script that runs the vLLM server.

We might need to adjust it based on your specific requirements, such as adding additional dependencies or configuring environment variables.
